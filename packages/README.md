# BobaBackend Packages

This directory contains NPM packages that are tightly coupled with the BobaBoard
server but cannot be released as part of it.

Currently, there is one single group of packages nested under `api-external/`.
It includes type-safe client libraries and API type definitions generated from
the OpenAPI specification.
